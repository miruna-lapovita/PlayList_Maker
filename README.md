# PlayList_Maker
This one is meant to be an aspiring-budget-spotify, written as a JavaFx programme, which gives you a list of songs and you have to give a playlist name. It'll generate random playlists that are no longer than 15 minutes and store them in a database. You can also browse through the list of songs by searching up any part of it. 

My first touch with a user interface, I am walking you through the process of how a search bar works and database conectivity. Overall, a great learning experience, that also got me the final grade in Advanced Programming methods.

Have fun and farawell, traveller!!
